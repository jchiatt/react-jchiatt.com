              Before we start to work on a project together, the best way for us both to understand the outcomes you’re looking for is to work through a Roadmapping Session together.<br /><br />

            A Roadmapping Sessions is where you and I will work together to dive into your business &mdash; where’s it’s been, where it is, and where you want it to go. Then, based on your available resources (<span className="em">such as timeline, budget, technical knowledge of staff, etc.</span>) we will explore the various routes that we can take to help get from where you are your to where you’re trying to go.

                In short, a Roadmapping Session is a low-cost tool that greatly reduces the risk of the project for both of us.

              <p className="roadmapping-paragraph">
                Reducing risk for both of us and ensuring that what we are aiming for aligns with your business goals means we are much more likely to be friends at the end of the engagement. Which is good. Because I like friends.

              <ol>
                <li>Produces a product of higher quality by aligning the final product with your business goals. A final product that doesn't get you closer to your business goals (more money, more time, happier customers, etc.) is useless and wasteful.</li>

                <li>Ensures time and money are not wasted building the wrong thing by defining exactly what we are building.</li>

                <li>Allows me to give you an upfront, fixed price for the rest of the engagement so you know exactly what you'll be spending before the project starts.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>How it reduces the risk for me</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>It helps me understand if I am the right person for your project or if someone else may be a better fit. If I can't get you closer to your business goals, I'm not going to take the project.</li>

                <li>It helps me prevent wasting time and money pursuing leads that aren't a good fit. Having you put some skin in the game upfront ensures you are serious about your project and that you aren't about to ask me to "basically build 75% of Uber" for free (which I've been asked).</li>

              <li><strong>Product Roadmap</strong> &mdash; We'll establish what the next steps are for the full project and what features / ideas should be punted on until a later time. For a new startup idea, this is where we'll define what your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is and what features could be implemented down the road.</li>

              <h2>How to prepare for a Roadmapping Session</h2>
              <p className="roadmapping-paragraph">
                A Roadmapping Session typically lasts between 2 and 4 hours. Other than having that block of time set aside, here are a few things you'll need to prepare:

                <ol>
                  <li>If you have existing analytics of your website or app, you'll need to have access to them and invite me to view them.</li>

                  <li>Prepare any wireframes, brand assets, code, or other assets that have been developed so I can review them.</li>

                  <li>Sit down and write what your main business goals are. Think short term (12-18 months) and long term (3-5 years). Make each goal something that can actually be measured.</li>

                  <li>Have a budget for the full project. I cannot work for free, and I don't want to waste either of our time going through a Roadmapping Session only to find that the session fee was your full budget. Please don't spend your entire budget on this Roadmapping Session. You will be disappointed.</li>
                </ol>

                  <p>As a startup company on a defined limited budget, I think we assumed much of the higher level functionality was out of our price range. However, J.C. helped craft a solution to customer specs while at the same time advising cost-savings moves. This maximized our budget by removing unnecessary scope and ultimately garnered us a better end product that was extremely high-quality. I would highly recommend working with J.C.</p>

              <p className="roadmapping-paragraph">
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>What happens after I apply?</strong><br />
                  I'll review your application and reply via email within a couple of business days with payment instructions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>What happens after I pay?</strong><br />
                  Once you submit your payment, you'll receive a link to schedule a Roadmapping Session on my calendar so you can book at your convenience.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>I'm nervous about sharing my business ideas...</strong><br />
                  This is a common feeling, but rest assured: whatever you share with me, you can share with me in confidence. I've been consulting for years. If I had loose lips, I wouldn't still be in business.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Will you sign a NDA before we speak?</strong><br />
                    No. For such a small engagement, there's no need to get lawyers involved. If we proceed with a larger engagement after the Roadmapping Session, I'll be happy to sign a limited-scope NDA.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Can my business partner(s) participate in the session too?</strong><br />
                    This conversation is best kept 1-on-1 between myself and the primary decision maker for whatever project you're looking to discuss. Too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the broth. You are welcome to record our conversation and share with your partner later.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Why not just send me an estimate and bill hourly? Why overcomplicate things?</strong><br />
                  <ol>
                    <li>Shooting off a timeline and budget estimation from the hip is a dangerous gamble in terms of getting you closer to the actual <em>outcomes</em> you're looking for. I've had clients who thought they needed Widget A (with a price tag of $50k-100k) when really they only needed Widget B (with a price tag of $4k).</li>
                    <li>Frankly put, humans (include myself) are <em>terrible</em> at estimating. Whatever timeline and budget I give you will inevitably be wrong.</li>
                    <li>I don't bill hourly. It is a terrible way to do business and hurts all parties involved.</li>
                  </ol>
                    </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>I can't afford the $1,500 fee. Will you come down on your price?</strong><br />
                    No, but I'm happy to recommend other people who may be a better fit for you if you have a smaller budget.
                    </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Can we work out an equity arrangement? I don't have any cash to pay you with.</strong><br />
                    No, I won't work for equity.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>What if you just take my money and skip town before the meeting?</strong><br />
                    Similar to my answer about being nervous about sharing information with me: if I had bad character, I wouldn't still be in business. If you need extra re-assurance, I'm happy to connect you with a few existing clients so you can feel at ease. If that's not good enough, then I'm probably not the right person for you.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>How much will my project cost? How long will my project take?</strong><br />
                    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ that's what the Roadmapping Session will help determine.

	            <p>You're not alone. Getting from the idea phase to actually having a product that makes you money is no easy task.</p>
	            <p>Over the past 5 years, I've advised numerous startups in order to help their idea to market. I've often played a "CTO for hire" role and helped ideas become software products.</p>
	            <p>Do you have an idea? Are you ready to take the next step forward but aren't sure what that step is?</p>
	            <p>If you answered yes, then you need to book a Roadmapping session with me. This is a 1 day event where we dive deep into your idea, identify the value you can bring to the market, and develop an actionable path forward. The fee for this is $1,499. To apply, simply send me an email at <a href="mailto:jc@builtbygood.co">jc@builtbygood.co</a></p>
